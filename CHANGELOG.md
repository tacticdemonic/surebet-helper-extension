## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.96.1] - 2025-12-01

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Market filter persistence**: Fixed incomplete `DEFAULT_UI_PREFERENCES` in contentScript.js that was missing market filter properties, causing settings to reset on extension updates. Now properly includes `marketFilterEnabled`, `marketFilterMode`, and `activePresets`.
- **Settings loading**: Changed from `||` to `??` (nullish coalescing) in `loadMarketFilterSettings()` to properly handle `false` values and ensure saved settings persist correctly.

## [1.0.96] - 2025-12-01

### ✨ New Features
- **On-site Market Filtering**: Added the ability to hide or highlight specific market types directly on the surebet.com valuebets page. Presets include Asian Handicap, DNB, Cards, Goals Only, and Corners Only. Supports Hide & Highlight modes and mirrors popup settings.
- **New Market Filter Presets**: Added three additional filter presets to block Shots, Player Props (goalscorers, assists), and Correct Score markets.
- **Real-time Filter Updates**: Market filters now apply immediately when toggled in settings/popup without requiring page reload. Content script listens to `uiPreferences` storage changes and reapplies filters in real-time.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Asian Handicap matching**: Improved regex compilation to detect abbreviations like `AH`, `AH1`, `AH2` and variations like `AH2(+1.5)` by using a lookahead. Added content-script-level filtering and highlight badge for easier identification.
- **Market filter toggle regression**: Fixed issue where disabling market filters wouldn't remove existing filter styling from rows until page reload. Filters now properly clear classes when disabled.
- **Settings preservation bug**: Fixed critical bug in `settings.js` where saving market filter settings would overwrite and discard other UI preferences like `hideLayBets` and `showPendingOnly`. Now properly merges with existing settings.
- **Highlight mode counter**: Fixed `marketFilteredCount` not incrementing in highlight mode, so the summary line now correctly reports the number of highlighted rows.
- **Storage listener gap**: Added missing `uiPreferences` handler in content script storage listener to enable real-time market filter updates without page reload.


## [1.0.82.2] - 2025-11-28

### 📝 Documentation & Housekeeping
- Updated docs to reflect manifest version 1.0.82.2 and updated key README and meta docs for clarity.
- Added minor consistency edits across documentation to remove outdated version labels.

## [1.0.78] - 2025-11-27

### ✨ New Features & Fixes
- **Per-bet Debug Logging**: Added `debugLogs` per bet (session-based, structured logs) capturing auto-fill attempts, selector diagnostics, and timing metrics.
- **Export Debug Logs**: Export pending-bets JSON now includes `debugLogs` for each bet (Settings → Data → Debug Export and Analysis → Export)
- **24-hour Log Retention**: Debug logs are filtered to the last 24 hours on save to prevent storage bloat.
- **Storage Size Check**: Background added `checkStorageSize` action to warn when storage usage exceeds 4MB; popup shows warning during export preparation.
- **Documentation**: Added `DEBUG_LOGGING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `DEBUG_LOGGING_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, and `DEBUG_LOGGING_EXPORT_FIX.md` with usage and troubleshooting guidance.
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed an issue where the "Settled" count in the popup summary showed the number of settled bets from all bets while the denominator reflected the filtered view (e.g., 'Pending Only') — the settled count is now derived from the currently visible (filtered) bets.


## [1.0.76] - 2025-11-26

### ✨ New Features
- **Advanced Analysis Dashboard**: Added comprehensive performance analysis tools to the Analysis tab.
- **Summary Statistics**: Persistent top-bar showing 9 key metrics (Yield, Profit Factor, Drawdown, Streaks, etc.).
- **Performance Tab**: New tab with three integrated analyses:
  - **Odds Band Performance**: ROI% and deviation by odds range (1.00-1.50, 1.51-2.00, etc.).
  - **Overvalue Distribution**: Calibration analysis of edge accuracy (0-1%, 1-2%, etc.).
  - **Sport Breakdown**: Profitability ranking by sport category.
- **Significance Indicators**: Visual de-emphasis (50% opacity) for metrics with low sample size (n<20).
- **Deviation Analysis**: All tables now show actual vs expected win rate deviation (+/- %).
- **Enhanced Export**: JSON exports now include all new performance metrics.
- **Debug Export (Pending Bets)**: Added a Settings → Data → Debug Export option to export pending bets as JSON for debugging CSV import and pending-state issues.

## [1.0.75] - 2025-11-26

- **Auto-Hide Bets**: Automatically hides bets on surebet.com immediately after saving them.
- **Dustbin Settings**: Configure the default hide action (Hide for 12h, 24h, or Permanently) in the extension settings.
- **Smart Menu Handling**: Automatically detects and clicks the correct "dustbin" menu item based on your preference.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed menu item detection in `contentScript.js` to correctly identify `<button>` elements in the dropdown menu.
