### Step 3: Test Basic Functionality

1. **Open Popup**
   - Click the extension icon in the toolbar
   - Popup window should open showing "Surebet Helper — Saved Bets"
   - Should see buttons: Check Results, API Setup, Import, View Chart, Export

2. **Test on Surebet.com**
   - Visit: https://surebet.com/valuebets
   - Look for "💾 Save" buttons on bet rows
   - Try clicking one to save a test bet
   - Open popup again - your bet should appear

3. **Test Export**
   - Click "Export JSON" or "Export CSV" in popup
   - File should download automatically

4. **Export Pending Bets (Debug)**
   - Open the extension Settings (⚙️ Settings)
   - Go to the **Data** tab
   - Click **🐛 Debug Export → Export Pending Bets (JSON)**
   - The file will download with only bets that are currently pending/unsettled — use this for debugging CSV import parser issues or verifying pending bet structure

### Troubleshooting

❌ **"Manifest file is invalid"**
- Make sure you selected the `surebet-helper-extension` folder, not the parent folder
- Verify `manifest.json` exists in the folder

❌ **"Service worker registration failed"**
- This is normal during development in some browsers
- The extension should still function correctly
- If issues persist, check browser console (F12)

❌ **Save buttons not appearing**
- Refresh the surebet.com page after installing
- Check that content script loaded (F12 → Console → look for Surebet Helper messages)
- Try disabling other extensions that might conflict

❌ **Extension removed after browser restart (Firefox)**
- This is expected with "Load Temporary Add-on"
- Use signing for permanent installation (see README.md)
- Or reload the temporary add-on each time

### Success! ✅

If all tests pass, your extension is properly installed and working!

**Next steps:**
- Configure API keys for auto-result checking (see API_SETUP.md)
- Customize bookmaker presets in contentScript.js
- Start tracking your bets!
