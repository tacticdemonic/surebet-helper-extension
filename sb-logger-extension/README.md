## Auto-Fill Stakes (Complete Feature - v1.0.37!)

The extension now fully implements automatic Kelly stake calculation and filling across all exchanges using a cross-origin broker pattern:

### How to use:
1. Click the extension icon and go to **⚙️ Auto-Fill** settings
2. Enable **"Enable automatic stake input on betting slip"**
3. Select which exchanges you want (Betfair, Smarkets, Matchbook, Betdaq)
4. When browsing surebet.com, **click a stake indicator** from your bet row (e.g., the stake amount)
5. You'll be redirected to the exchange betting slip
6. Your calculated Kelly stake will automatically populate on the betting slip

### How it works (Complete Pipeline):
1. **Stake indicator clicked** → Broker service stores bet data (in-memory + backup storage)
2. **Navigate to exchange** → Content script queries broker for pending bet
3. **Broker retrieves data** → Returns cached bet data from safe background context
4. **Kelly calculation** → Extension calculates optimal stake based on odds/probability
5. **Auto-fill stake** → Betting slip input receives calculated amount
6. **Validation** → Odds compared; warning shown if significantly changed
7. **Success notification** → User sees confirmation stake was filled
8. **You review & place** → You manually confirm odds and place the bet
9. **Fallback chain** → If broker unavailable: Storage → Document referrer → Parent frame

### Supported Exchanges:
- ✅ **Betfair** - Fully supported (v1.0+)
- ✅ **Smarkets** - Complete (v1.0.37: Broker + Kelly calculation)
- ✅ **Matchbook** - Fully supported (v1.0+)
- ✅ **Betdaq** - Fully supported (v1.0+)

### Settings:
- **Per-exchange toggle**: Enable/disable for each exchange individually
- **Disabled by default**: Must explicitly enable for safety
- **Timeout**: Waits up to 10 seconds for betting slip to appear
- **Odds Validation**: Warns if odds change after you clicked the bet

### Odds Validation ⚠️
The extension compares the odds from your surebet.com link with the current odds on the betting slip:
- If odds differ slightly (±0.01), auto-fill proceeds silently
- If odds change significantly, you'll see a warning notification but auto-fill still happens
- This helps you catch when odds have shifted before placing the bet

## What gets saved
Each bet record includes:
- **Timestamp** - When you saved it
- **Bookmaker** - Betting site (e.g., Bet365, Unibet)
- **Sport** - Sport type
- **Event** - Match/game name
- **Tournament** - League/competition
- **Market** - Bet type (e.g., "Home", "Over 2.5")
- **Odds** - Decimal odds value
- **Probability** - Calculated probability %
- **Overvalue** - Value edge %
- **Stake** - Your bet amount (manual entry)
- **Potential Return** - Stake × Odds
- **Profit** - Potential Return - Stake
- **Expected Value (EV)** - (Win Probability × Win Amount) - (Lose Probability × Stake)
- **Status** - Pending/Won/Lost/Void
- **Settled At** - When you marked the bet as settled
- **Actual P/L** - Real profit/loss after settlement
- **Note** - Optional personal note
- **URL** - Link back to the page
## Distribution Package

To distribute the extension or prepare for Chrome Web Store submission:

```powershell
# PowerShell (Windows) - Create distribution ZIP
Compress-Archive -Path .\surebet-helper-extension\* -DestinationPath .\surebet-helper-extension.zip -Force
```

```bash
# Linux/Mac - Create distribution ZIP
cd surebet-helper-extension
zip -r ../surebet-helper-extension.zip . -x "*.git*" -x "*node_modules*"
```

### Chrome Web Store Publishing
1. Create a developer account at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devcenter/
2. Pay one-time $5 registration fee
3. Upload the ZIP file created above
4. Fill in store listing details (description, screenshots, etc.)
5. Submit for review (usually approved within a few days)

### Firefox Add-ons Publishing
1. Create an account at https://addons.mozilla.org/
2. Submit your extension for review at https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/
3. Choose self-distribution or listed in Mozilla Add-ons store
4. Review process typically takes a few days= (Probability% / 100 × Stake × Odds) - ((1 - Probability% / 100) × Stake)
```

**Example:** Stake 10 at odds 2.5 with 41.51% probability:
```
EV = (0.4151 × 10 × 2.5) - (0.5849 × 10)
EV = 10.3775 - 5.849 = +4.53
```

### Summary Bar Metrics:
- **Total EV**: Sum of EV for ALL bets (pending + settled) - your theoretical expected profit
- **P/L**: Actual profit/loss for settled bets only
- **Expected (Settled)**: Sum of EV for settled bets only
- **vs Expected**: Difference between actual P/L and expected (settled bets)

### What This Means:
- **Total EV** tracks your overall edge - if positive, your bets have theoretical value
- **vs Expected** shows if you're running lucky (+) or unlucky (-)
- Over 100+ bets, actual should approach expected if probabilities are accurate

## Package (PowerShell — Windows)
```powershell
# Run in the parent folder to create a zip:
Compress-Archive -Path .\surebet-helper-extension\* -DestinationPath .\surebet-helper-extension.zip -Force

**Note:** API setup is optional. If you don't configure APIs, you can still settle bets manually using the Won/Lost/Void buttons.

## Bookmaker Filter Presets

The extension adds two quick-filter buttons at the top of the bookmaker filter popup:

### Preset Configuration
Edit the `BOOKMAKER_PRESETS` object in `contentScript.js` to customize your presets:

```javascript
const BOOKMAKER_PRESETS = {
  normal: [
    '10Bet', '888sport', 'Bet365', 'Betfair', 'Betway', 
    'Bwin', 'Ladbrokes', 'Paddy Power', 
    'Unibet', 'BetVictor', 'Betfred'
  ],
  exchanges: [
    'Betfair', 'Betdaq', 'Smarkets', 'Matchbook'
  ]
};
```

### Matching Rules
- **"Betfair"** matches only "Betfair 5%" (main version without country code)
- **"Betfair (AU)"** matches only "Betfair (AU) 5%" (Australian version)
- **"Betfair (IT)"** matches only "Betfair (IT) 5%" (Italian version)
- Country-specific versions are automatically excluded unless explicitly specified

This ensures you only select the exact bookmaker versions you want, without accidentally selecting all regional variants.

## Next steps
- Test on surebet.com/valuebets
- Customize your bookmaker presets in `contentScript.js`
- Verify all fields are captured correctly
- (Optional) Set up free APIs for automatic result checking - see [API_SETUP.md](API_SETUP.md)
- Try exporting CSV to validate data structure
- Consider adding filters/search in popup for large bet lists

## Contributing DOM Structures for New Exchanges

We rely on community contributions for maintaining accurate DOM selectors for exchange betting slips. To make it easy, we've added a helper script and a GitHub issue template you can use when submitting a new exchange or fixing selectors.

### Quick & Recommended (Best) Way — Use the Console Helper Script

1. Open the betting slip for the exchange you want to support (e.g., Betfair) in your browser.
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Console.
3. Copy the helper script from `tools/collect_betslip_info.js` in this repo and paste it into the Console, then press Enter.
   - The script will collect visible stake inputs, betting slip containers, and relevant data attributes.
   - It will copy a JSON payload to your clipboard containing the page URL, detected inputs, container HTML, data attributes, and your user agent.
4. Create a new GitHub issue using the **Add Exchange Support** template (click "New issue" → "Add Exchange Support") and paste the copied JSON into the "Console output" field.

#### Bookmarklet (one-click issue creation)

If you prefer a one-click approach, use our bookmarklet generator to create a bookmark that collects the necessary JSON and opens a prefilled GitHub issue:

1. Open `surebet-helper-extension/tools/create_issue_bookmarklet.js` in this repo and copy the single `javascript:(function(){...})();` string printed by the script.
2. Create a new browser bookmark, paste the string into the bookmark URL.
3. When on an exchange's betting slip, click the bookmark to auto-collect DOM data and open a new GitHub issue with the JSON and HTML prefilled.

Note: If the collected JSON is too large, the issue page will open with empty fields and you'll be prompted to paste the JSON manually.

### Manual Alternative

If you prefer to do this manually, or the helper script doesn’t run, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the betting slip** on the exchange you want to support.
2. **Open DevTools** (F12 on most browsers).
3. **Run the diagnostic snippet** in the Console tab to identify key elements:

```javascript
// Find betting slip containers
console.log('=== BETTING SLIP CONTAINERS ===');
document.querySelectorAll('[class*="slip"], [class*="bet"], [class*="order"], [class*="panel"], .betslip-container').forEach(el => {
  if (el.className && el.offsetHeight > 50) {
    console.log('Container:', el.className, el);
  }
});

// Find all stake inputs (numbers, text fields, or Betfair-style inputs)
console.log('\n=== STAKE INPUT FIELDS ===');
document.querySelectorAll('input[type="number"], input[type="text"], input.betslip-size-input, input[bf-number-restrict]').forEach(el => {
  if (el.offsetHeight > 0) {
    console.log('Input:', {
      type: el.type || '',
      className: el.className || '',
      placeholder: el.placeholder || '',
      name: el.name || '',
      id: el.id || '',
      value: el.value || '',
      parent: el.parentElement?.className || ''
    }, el);
  }
});

// Data attributes useful for building selectors
console.log('\n=== DATA ATTRIBUTES ===');
document.querySelectorAll('[data-test], [data-testid], [data-test-id]').forEach(el => {
  if (el.offsetHeight > 0) {
    console.log('Data:', el.dataset, el);
  }
});
```

4. **Right-click the stake input field** → Inspect Element, then copy the HTML for that input element and at least 2–3 parent levels up. Include all class names and data attributes.
5. **Create a new GitHub issue** using the Add Exchange Support template and include:
   - Exchange name and domain
   - Browser and OS used for testing
   - Copied JSON from the helper script (preferred) or the console output
   - Full HTML of the stake input and parent containers
   - Screenshot showing the input in the betting slip (recommended)

### Example Submission

When opening an issue, the template will prompt you for the required fields. Here's an example:

```markdown
## Add Support for Betdaq

**Console JSON:**
```
{ "url":"https://...", "timestamp":"...", "inputs":[{...}], "containers":[...], "dataAttributes":[...], "userAgent":"..." }
```

**HTML Structure:**
```html
<div class="betting-slip__container">
  <div class="betting-slip__form">
    <input type="text" class="input-field stake-input" placeholder="Enter stake">
  </div>
</div>
```

**Browser:** Firefox 120 on Windows

**Screenshot:** [attach screenshot]
```

### What Happens Next

1. A developer will review your issue.
2. We’ll add or refine selectors in `BETTING_SLIP_SELECTORS` in `contentScript.js`.
3. We’ll test and commit changes in an upcoming release.
4. You're credited in `UPGRADE_NOTES.md` if you wish to be.

### Maintainer checklist (for devs)

- Add new selectors to `BETTING_SLIP_SELECTORS` in `contentScript.js` using the same pattern as other exchanges (specific selectors first, fallbacks last).
- Verify the selector doesn't match elements inside `.surebet-helper-stake-panel` and that `findElement()` will skip our UI components.
- Use `tools/collect_betslip_info.js` to reproduce the issue and confirm the selector targets the correct input on desktop and mobile viewports.
- Test auto-fill by enabling the Auto-Fill feature and reproducing the save → redirect flow from surebet.com to the exchange.
- Commit and reference the issue in the PR description for traceability.

### Developer tools

In `surebet-helper-extension/tools` you'll find two helper utilities:
- `collect_betslip_info.js` — paste into an exchange betting slip console to collect DOM data (JSON copied to clipboard)
- `bookmarklet-demo.html` — a demo page that provides a bookmarklet string and instructions for creating a one-click issue bookmarklet

We recommend using the bookmarklet for quick issue creation and the console helper when you need the full JSON payload for maintainers.

### Why This Helps

- Auto-fill is more reliable with precise selectors.
- Sites change frequently; community contributions help keep support working.
- You get faster support for sites you use often.
