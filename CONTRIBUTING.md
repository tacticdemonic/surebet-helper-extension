#### Pull Request Guidelines

   git clone https://github.com/tacticdemonic/sb-logger-extension.git
   cd sb-logger-extension
   ```

   - **Firefox**: Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click "Load Temporary Add-on"

3. Make your changes and reload the extension to test

## Code Style

- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch

## Testing

Before submitting a PR:
1. Test on surebet.com/valuebets with real data
2. Test the save button injection
3. Test bet settlement (Won/Lost/Void)
