### Auto-Fill Stakes (Exchange Bets)
When enabled, the extension automatically fills in your calculated Kelly stake after clicking a bet link:

1. **Enable auto-fill** in Settings > ⚙️ Auto-Fill tab
2. **Select exchanges** you want to use (Betfair, Smarkets, Matchbook)

4. **Review and place** your bet on the exchange

**Supported Exchanges:**
- Betfair ✓
- Smarkets ✓
- Matchbook ✓ (Back bets, with React/data-hook selectors)

**Note**: Auto-fill requires the Surebet official plugin to find and add the bet first. Falls back to clipboard copy if auto-fill fails.

### Bookmaker Filter Presets

The extension adds quick-filter buttons to the bookmaker filter popup:
- **⭐ My Normal List** - Your standard bookmaker selection
- **🔄 Exchanges Only** - Filter to betting exchanges only

Customize these presets in `contentScript.js` by editing the `BOOKMAKER_PRESETS` object.

1. **Starting Bankroll** - Your initial betting bank (automatically adjusted by P/L)
2. **Kelly Fraction (%)** - Percentage of full Kelly to stake (25% recommended)

The Kelly Criterion calculates optimal bet sizes based on odds and probability. Your extension automatically:
- Calculates recommended stakes for every bet
- Displays stakes on surebet.com value bet rows
- Auto-fills stakes on betting exchanges (if enabled)
- Tracks actual vs recommended stakes in analysis

## 📊 What Gets Saved

Each bet record includes:
- **Timestamp** - When you saved it
- **Bookmaker** - Betting site (e.g., Bet365, Betfair)
- **Sport** - Sport type
- **Event** - Match/game name
- **Tournament** - League/competition
- **Market** - Bet type (e.g., "Home", "Over 2.5")
- **Odds** - Decimal odds value
- **Probability** - Calculated probability %
- **Overvalue** - Value edge %
- **Stake** - Your bet amount
- **Potential Return** - Stake × Odds
- **Profit** - Potential Return - Stake
- **Expected Value (EV)** - Theoretical expected profit
- **Status** - Pending/Won/Lost/Void
- **Settled At** - Settlement timestamp
- **Actual P/L** - Real profit/loss after settlement
- **Note** - Optional personal note
- **URL** - Link back to the original page

---

## 🧮 Understanding Expected Value (EV)

Expected Value is the theoretical average profit you'd make on a bet if placed many times:

```
EV = (Win Probability × Win Amount) - (Lose Probability × Stake)
```

**Example:** $10 stake at 2.50 odds with 41.51% probability:
```
EV = (0.4151 × $10 × 2.50) - (0.5849 × $10)
EV = $10.38 - $5.85 = +$4.53
```

### Summary Metrics
- **Total EV**: Sum of EV for all bets (theoretical expected profit)
- **P/L**: Actual profit/loss for settled bets
- **Expected (Settled)**: Sum of EV for settled bets only
- **vs Expected**: Difference between actual and expected (luck factor)

Over 100+ bets, actual results should approach expected value if probabilities are accurate.
